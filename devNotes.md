@1055 Currently satisfied with the landing page :D 
	  - just need to implement the glitch effect properly

@1045 Landing page transition fully implemented - and significantly cleaner T-T

@1015 At this point, css for the landing page menu developed.
	  (I have to go watch the glitch tut to add the full effect)

	  cleaned up the "fade on link click" JS as well,
	  seems to work as intended across all pages...

	  Would need to know where / what the links are on each page
	  before I can implement the "fade on link click" per page...

@0635 cleaned up landing.js further.
	  Working on sectionTitle funtion, and then sectionSwitch

	  should be able to combine them both into a function then run
	  by the button

@0850 added code / modules for simple, self reloading server
	 Menu button css also added

@0825 Reorganized the landing page
	-div#header
		-div#titleWrapper
		-div#carouselWrapper (needs to be renamed to this)
		-button#sectionSwitch
	-section#landing
	-section#menu

Must start planning out DOM structure in advanced too T- T
especially in regards to JS - currently targetting individual elements
for section switch, rather than their wrappers T- T

Gonna fix button now, 
then make changes to menu
need to reWatch that video by Kevin Powell

@1720 need to work on landing section menu, the transition button and such...
	  - need to find that glitch tutorial by ... Kevin Powell. Glad I left credit in the notes :D

@1600 Decided to leave carousel code alone for now.

@1530 Only the css animations and media queries need to be changed concerning the carousel,
	  rest of original code seems more or less sufficient

@0210 plot out converting all page animations over to JS web animations
	  
	  have to convert entire carousel layout to web animations...

@1225 Beginning seperation of site sections...

	  - fonts and logos moved into their own folders

	  - sections have their own pages, initial set up

	  - deleted original navigation html code

	  - On Index / Landing - Logo is now an img element

	  - about section to be built from scratch

	  - code for keeping track of active section, deleted
	  	- all index.html JS deleted...

	  - code for fade in on page arrival, fade out on page leave implemented
