
## Portfolio Site - Development Version


#01. 25. 2023

@0850 added code / modules for simple, self reloading server

@0825 Reorganized the landing page
	-div#header
		-div#titleWrapper
		-div#carouselWrapper (needs to be renamed to this)
		-button#sectionSwitch
	-section#landing
	-section#menu

Must start planning out DOM structure in advanced too T- T
especially in regards to JS - currently targetting individual elements
for section switch, rather than their wrappers T- T

Gonna fix button now, 
then make changes to menu
need to reWatch that video by Kevin Powell

@1720 need to work on landing section menu, the transition button and such...
	  - need to find that glitch tutorial by ... Kevin Powell. Glad I left credit in the notes :D

@1600 Decided to leave carousel code alone for now.

@1530 Only the css animations and media queries need to be changed concerning the carousel,
	  rest of original code seems more or less sufficient

@0210 plot out converting all page animations over to JS web animations
	  
	  have to convert entire carousel layout to web animations...

@1225 Beginning seperation of site sections...

	  - fonts and logos moved into their own folders

	  - sections have their own pages, initial set up

	  - deleted original navigation html code

	  - On Index / Landing - Logo is now an img element

	  - about section to be built from scratch

	  - code for keeping track of active section, deleted
	  	- all index.html JS deleted...
